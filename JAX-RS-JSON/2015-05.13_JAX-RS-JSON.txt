JAX-RS is a Java API designed to be used as a standard to simplify the development of RESTful Web Services and their clients.
Jersey RESTful Web Services framework is an open-source Reference Implementation of this API that is JSR-311 compliant. 
We are going to use Jersey. JSON should be a heard of term. 
It is an acronym that stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language. 
It is a lightweight data-interchange format that is widely used since it is easy and simple to be understood and 
parsed for both humans and machines. 
Think of it as a simple set of key:value pairs represented as myJson = {“name”:”Lily”, “age”:9}.
Jackson is the tool to convert objects to/from JSON.
