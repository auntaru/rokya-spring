Baza de date (SCHEMA.DDL) se creeaza prin JUnit test :
org.timesheet.integration.HibernateConfigurationTest.java !!! 

Atentie si la : 
   org.timesheet.web.helpers.EntityGenerator

Run on Server Tomcat 7 (8)
http://localhost:8080/org.timesheet/timesheets

A timesheet management application is gradually created in this series and each tutorial builds on top of the previous one. 
All main aspects of a web application are taken care of, including both server side and client side functionality.
